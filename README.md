# The Canny Calendar-Chronograph

Light-emitting diodes and mini-computers are great for making a clock yourself. So you can see the time very well at night and, at day, the clock reminds you of important dates. In addition to own designs, it is also possible to set favorite melodies for the alarm and to play voice messages. We designed multifunctional clocks by combining various materials such as wood and electronics. The result are somewhat "different", very personal clocks with many interactive possibilities.
